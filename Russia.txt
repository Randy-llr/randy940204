# I will write my Russian trip experience on this page

2019-06-22
The first day I arrived at Moscow Sheremetyevo airport then bought train ticket to hotel.
Met Julia on the subway and found my room by her help. After putting down my luggage, we 
visited a big shopping market nearby.I wanna try Russia food so she recommend a kind of
sweet pancake to me, but it's too sweet to me.
